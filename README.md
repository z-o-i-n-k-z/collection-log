# collection-log

*A Blizzard-truthful collectible tracker for World of Warcraft*

Collection Log is a lightweight addon that tracks your collectible progress across raids and dungeons — inspired by the Old School RuneScape Collection Log, but built natively around Blizzard’s APIs and collection systems.

The goal is simple:

> Track what you’ve collected. See what you’re missing. No heuristics. No guesswork. No fake data.

## ✨ Core Features

* 📜 Raid & Dungeon loot tracking
* 🐎 Mount tracking using Blizzard’s Mount Journal
* 🐾 Pet tracking using the Pet Journal
* 🎲 Toys supported with proper collected state
* 🎨 Appearance tracking based on Blizzard transmog data
* 📊 Clean Overview tab with progress totals
* 🔒 Lock indicators & visual clarity
* ⚡ Lightweight and performance-conscious

All collection checks use Blizzard’s official APIs. If Blizzard says you have it, Collection Log reflects that.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

Collection Log is built around a few principles:

* **Blizzard-truthful only** — no external databases, no scraped data.
* **Deterministic tracking** — no phantom difficulties, no 0/0 bugs.
* **Offline data packs** — structured expansion/instance data for stability.
* **Minimal UI clutter** — OSRS-inspired clarity inside WoW’s ecosystem.

This is not meant to replace All The Things.
It’s meant to provide a focused, clean collectible tracking experience.
